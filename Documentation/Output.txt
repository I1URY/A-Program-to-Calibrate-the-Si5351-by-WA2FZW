Si5351 Calibration Program

Initializing EEPROM

Enter calibration test frequency in Hertz		<== 10,000,000 Entered
Calibration will be performed at: 10,000,000 Hz

When asked to enter a new correction factor, you may enter:

    nnnnn (or =nnnnn) to set a new value
    +nnnn to add an offset to the current value
    -nnnn to subtract an offset from the current value
    The enter key to use the current value
    or 'R' or 'r' to reset the correction factor to zero
    or 'S' or 's' to save the correction and get a new test frequency
    or 'N' or 'n' to get a new test frequency without saving
    or 'Q' or 'q' to quit and save the value in the EEPROM

Checking for previous correction factor.
EEPROM contains correction factor: 7,000
We will start with that value.

Enter a new correction factor or offset or
hit 'Enter' to use the current correction factor	<== Entered -4,000

Correction factor set to: 3,000

Enter a new correction factor or offset or
hit 'Enter' to use the current correction factor	<== Entered 'r'

Correction factor set to:   0

Enter a new correction factor or offset or
hit 'Enter' to use the current correction factor	<== Entered 3,000

Correction factor set to: 3,000

Correction factor is saved in the EEPROM		<== Entered 's'

Enter calibration test frequency in Hertz		<== Entered 5000000

Calibration will be performed at:  5,000,000 Hz

	Instructions repeated here

Correction factor set to: 3,000

Enter a new correction factor or offset or
hit 'Enter' to use the current correction factor	<== Entered 'q'

Correction factor is saved in the EEPROM
Execution terminated! 


Note:	If the EEPROM does not contain a valid offset, you will see the
	following message:

		EEPROM does not contain a valid correction factor.
		Initializing the correction factor to:   0

Note:	If the user just hits 'Enter' when asked for the frequency at shich
	to perform the test, the following messages willl be displayed:

		Using default test frequency.
		Calibration will be performed at: 10,000,000 Hz
